# Security Policy

At **AbacatePay**, we take security seriously and are committed to protecting
our users, partners, and the open-source community that relies on our libraries
and SDKs.

This document describes how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities
found in any AbacatePay open-source project.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it through one of the following channels:

</div>

- Email: **security@abacatepay.com**
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred, when available)

<div align="center">

When reporting, include as much information as possible:

</div>

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any known mitigations or suggestions

---

<div align="center">

## Response Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

</div>

- We will acknowledge receipt within **48 business hours**
- The issue will be reviewed and triaged
- A fix will be developed based on severity and impact
- We will coordinate a responsible disclosure after a fix is available

<div align="center">

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you **do not publicly disclose** any vulnerability
until we have had the opportunity to investigate and address it.

We strongly support and appreciate responsible disclosure practices.

---

## Credentials and Secrets

Accidental exposure of API keys, tokens, or other sensitive credentials
is considered **critical severity**.

If you believe credentials were leaked:

</div>

- Report the issue immediately via the channels above
- Avoid sharing the exposed data publicly

<div align="center">

## Scope

This security policy applies to **all repositories and packages**
maintained under the AbacatePay organization, including all libraries
and SDKs distributed through this monorepo.

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and contributors
who help keep the AbacatePay ecosystem secure.

Thank you for helping us improve the safety and reliability of our software.
